It’s refined, elegant, and it does its job well. So, it’s no surprise it’s been the go-to mac app for Markdown editing for over a decade now. </p><p>iA Writer integrates a simple file management solution that may be adequate for most users, but may not be enough for power users trying to create a productivity system or PKM style “second brain.” Those users may be more interested in something like Obsidian… </p><h2 id=\"obsidian\"><a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a></h2>\n<p>No list of markdown editors would be complete without the undisputed king of robust markdown editing. If you’re looking for a markdown editing experience that can become a full productivity system, then you’ll find no peer. It has a massive library of community created plugins for pretty much anything. </p><p>Note that Obsidian’s strength is also its curse. Some users find the complexity created by its near limitless configuration options overwhelming. Some find that they end up spending more time maintaining their Obsidian-based productivity system than they do actually being productive.</p><h2 id=\"typora\"><a href=\"https://typora.io/\">Typora</a></h2>\n<p>Typora is often compared to iA Writer with good reason. They’re both minimalistic and simple. To highlight the major difference, I’d say that Typora is more focused on advanced editing capabilities while iA Writer seeks to be a more simplified experience to keep you creative and productive. In other words, if you need advanced markdown features like math/diagram support, then Typora may be your best option.  </p><h2 id=\"bear\"><a href=\"https://bear.app/\">Bear</a></h2>\n<p>When Bear came onto the scene, it redefined elegance for iOS and macOS productivity apps. Its tag-first approach to organizing notes remains unique and one of the most flexible ways to organize a large library of notes. </p><p>Where some users may want more is around advanced personal knowledge management (PKM) and automation features. In that case, you’re looking to build a sophisticated productivity system, something like Obsidian may be a better fit.</p><p>I have a hard time criticizing it, it’s my favorite macOS app of all time, and a huge inspiration for… </p><h2 id=\"ally\"><a href=\"https://heyally.ai/\">Ally</a></h2>\n<p>A new comer, what makes Ally unique is its unique <a href=\"https://heyally.ai/features/local-llm\">local AI-first</a> approach to knowledge management and AI collaboration. </p><p>There’s no separation between your Markdown docs and what the AI “sees” so you can quickly switch back and forth between editing/creation and an AI that’s always in sync. It also offers a uniquely flexible node system where nodes are simulateously markdown docs, folders, and chats so you can add new nodes without wasting any resources on whether you need a folder, doc, or chat. </p>",

Even on macOS, an operating system built for the desktop/laptop format, and so tailored toward productivity, work, and creation, they’re, at least in some ways, intentionally <em>designed to divert our attention away from whatever we’re trying to do</em>, such as for alerts and notifications.

It simply minimizes distracting visual clutter by devoting the entire screen to a single app. This is an app experience that’s default behavior on Windows, but not macOS. Both modes have their uses and benefits, so it doesn’t really make sense to frame it as a “right or wrong” debate. </p><p>But, for deep work, work that requires prolonged intense focus to be productive, many of us benefit from minimal distraction, and things like macOS’s full-screen mode help a lot by massively trimming distracting and potentially overwhelming visual noise. For anyone closer to the challenging end of the attention spectrum, the “multi-task mode” that macOS encourages by default can actually be a sneaky productivity killer. It can feel like we’re getting a lot done, but we’re really shuffling around windows and never really delving deep enough into any particular thing to solve a complex problem, come up with a great new idea, or uncover important nuance in a data set.  </p><p>Now <a href=\"https://heyally.ai\">Ally</a> supports full-screen mode so you can laser focus on whatever doc you’re creating, web clipping you’re reading, or AI chat you’re having. </p><p>To get started, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ally-ai-for-life/id6752736179\">download the latest version of the Ally AI app from the macOS app store</a>. </p><p>With the <a href=\"https://heyally.ai\">Ally app</a> running, press the key combination <code>fn + f</code> or click the green circle icon in the upper left-hand corner of the app. </p><p>To exit full screen mode, you can press <code>esc</code>, <code>fn + f</code> again, or click the green circle icon that appears when you hover the upper left-hand corner of the app while in full screen mode.</p><p>You can also arrange the Ally app side by side with other apps, such as a web browser or PDF viewer, by clicking and holding the green circle icon, then selecting one of the tile options to arrange the window. </p><p>Now you can focus better with fewer visual distractions competing for your attention. </p><p>I’ll continue looking for new ways to leverage Apple’s ecosystem to make productivity easier with Ally.
