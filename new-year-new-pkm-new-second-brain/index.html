So, before you invest any more time into this article, you should know part of my motivation for writing it is that you’ll read the article, the app will sound useful, and you’ll give it a shot. However, the other reason I wrote it is because I think there’s genuinely useful information to share and whether you try to my app or not, I think the idea holds value. If you don’t like my app, I highly recommend the incredible Bear app which is a huge inspiration and influence of mine.</em></p><p>I am a productivity nerd. I cannot stay away from a shiny new productivity app. I’m one of “those people” who has spent way too much time tweaking Obsidian plugins, configuring complex “life organizing” Notion templates, tweaking logic in Airtable databases with multi-views for multi-year plans, etc. I am guilty of investing way too much time into the tools, and not enough time into utilizing those tools toward productivity.</p><p>It’s a constant war, but these days I’m doing much better, thank you. But let’s talk about you…</p><h2 id="why-wasting-time-might-be-the-productivity-boost-you-need-in-2026">Why wasting time might be the productivity boost you need in 2026</h2><p>In productivity circles, from the gurus themselves, there’s oft given, but too oft ignored, sage advice:</p><blockquote><p>Be careful you don’t spend too much time working on your tools and not enough time using your tools to be productive. Because that’s the whole point.</p></blockquote><p>So:</p><ul><li>No, you don’t need that fancy new database to track your habits.</li><li>No, you don’t need to migrate to yet another tool.</li><li>No, you probably shouldn’t test out that new AI plugin.</li></ul><p>Usually, it’s the right advice. I joke about it a lot, but if you’re actually spending more time tweaking your tooling than getting things done, then you’re in a bad spot and should find your way out ASAP. You need to commit to a tool and get work done. If you can’t, you’re probably avoiding work and you need to address that.</p><p>But, if it’s been a year or so since you’ve switched tools I’d argue you should give a completely new productivity tool a try. Whether it’s your project management solution, your PKM, or your todo list manager, find a shiny new tool that catches your eye and give it a try. Download that app you’ve had your eye on but haven’t made time to trial.</p><h2 id="getting-the-perfect-fresh-start-state-of-mind-for-the-new-year">Getting the perfect “fresh start” state of mind for the new year</h2><p>It’s probably a stretch to even bring it up, but in Zen Buddhism there is a concept called “Beginner’s Mind,” which is basically intentionally adopting the mindset of someone that is experiencing and learning something for the first time. You try to approach something as if it is fresh and new and with a perfectly open mind.</p><p>Whether we’re meditating or cutting 2x4s, we develop mental cruft and automation that can impede us from viewing our meditation, our next cut, or our life through a truly unbiased lens. What’s really tricky is, since the lens is our reality, it’s invisible to us. It’s extraordinarily challenging to actually get into that mental state after you’re already familiar with something.</p><p>One thing I’ve noticed, as I jump from app to app, is what I call “the clean slate” moment. It’s the moment where you decide to invest in a completely new productivity solution. Whether you’re migrating from Apple Notes to Obsidian to Google Keep and back again, this isn’t just a sloppy import &gt; export. You aren’t just importing your notes, todos, and projects.</p><p>No, you’ve committed to re-thinking your life from the ground up. The new tool that’s going to skyrocker your productivity is just the catalyst, the reason, the canvas, but now you’re doing something amazing: you’re thinking about your life in a way you probably don’t do very often.</p><p>When you adopt a new PKM or project management solution or todo list tool, you’re forced to think about your life from a higher level with really insightfuly questions like:</p><ul><li>Do I want to keep my work and personal life separate?</li><li>Should my side projects be considered work or personal or something else?</li><li>How should I group my life into buckets? What would those buckets be?</li><li>How should I order my projects? By priority? Due date?</li><li>And so on.</li></ul><p>Your mind will just naturally flow through a fascinating series of self-inquiry questions that help you organize your life into a structure that makes sense to you. Without even conciously trying, you’ll find that you get honest about abandoned projects that should get archived, mental clutter gets cleared, your life comes into focus, and you feel like you’re ready to do anything.</p><p>You’ve finally done it. You’ve designed <em>the ultimate productivity system.</em> The one. It was you. And now you’re all set to be the world’s most productive person.</p><h2 id="and-the-hard-part-begins">And the hard part begins</h2><p>Unfortunately, you’ve burned through the “new tool” dopamine and your next hit means actually getting something done. No problem, you’ve still got all the motivation and momentum from using <em>the ultimate productivity system</em> that you created.</p><p>But, how do you keep your new system organized over time? How do you keep your Inbox from filling up? How do you keep yourself using the system you’ve designed?</p><p>There is all sorts of friction involved with actually utilizing and maintaining a system. Trust me, I’ve tried everything from GTD, to PARA, to Zettlekasten, to dozens of custom systems that borrow from yonder and hither.</p><p>In order for a personal productivity system to work it needs:</p><ul><li>Fresh input - It needs to be kept in sync with your life</li><li></li></ul><p>Here’s my understanding of the problem:</p><p>-</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 8, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tags/pkm/">pkm</a></li><li><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tags/productivity/">productivity</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a href="https://heyally.ai">Back to Ally AI main site</a></p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://heyally.ai/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://heyally.ai/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
