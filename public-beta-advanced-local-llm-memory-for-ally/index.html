I’ve invested heavily into creating a sophisticated context system that allows Ally to not just recall, but understand the relationships between concepts and information. Multiple layers of context are added to help Ally understand not only what you’re working on at this very moment, but also how it fits into the bigger picture.</p><p>These two new memory features are two additional layers on top of Ally’s unique Shared Context feature.</p><p>Now, as you chat with Ally, it automatically stores key facts and information. This works very similar to the automatic memory features of ChatGPT and Claude.</p><p>As you work, your notes are automatically converted into vector embeddings so they can be searched. Then, your chats and notes are automatically processed into an evolving knowledge graph that stores how information is related.</p><p>All of this means Ally does more than just store and retain information, it understands your life by combining context from many sources.</p><h2 id="how-to-turn-on-the-advanced-memory-and-context-features-beta">How to turn on the advanced memory and context features beta:</h2><p>Starting with macOS v1.3.3, if you go into <code>Settings &gt; AI</code> and scroll below the list of LLMs, you’ll see a couple of new options to enable Ally’s advanced memory features:</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="http://briangladu-dropshare.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-1.39.24-PM.png" alt="image" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>Please note that turning on memory features will slow response times.

That’s because Ally was also created to impose or enforce as little structure and limitations as possible. If something structural is being considered, for instance, “How should notes be organized?,” it gets filtered through “How would this work with the GTD system?” If it’s incompatible with GTD, or other popular productivity and PKM systems like PARA or zettlekasten, it doesn’t make the&hellip;</p><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/setting-up-a-gtd-system-in-ally-ai/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/themes-for-ally/">Themes for Ally!</a></h3></header><p>Now you can customize the look and feel of Ally on iOS and macOS with three themes.
