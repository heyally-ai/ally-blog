Really easy. Because if it’s not easy, you won’t do it. Neither will I. Friction kills productivity.</p><p>Throughout the day, there’s all kinds of information we should, need to, or want to save. Dates, reminders, random ideas, shopping lists, etc. To assist you, your PKM or productivity system needs these updates in as close to real-time as possible, so it stays in sync with your life.</p><p>Often, we come across web content — the perfect Reddit post, a great tutorial, a must try recipe — that we want to save for later. We may want to make sure we add it to our “read it later” reading list. Or catalog it into our recipe archive so we can put it into rotation for family meals.</p><p>If we bookmark it, it might disappear and we have yet another place to check for information we need contributing to that frustrating “I know it’s somewhere…” phenomena that often ends with Googling for it again, defeating the purpose of bookmarking or having a PKM solution.</p><p>Now, saving web content is easy.</p><h2 id="introducing-the-ally-web-clipper-safari-extension">Introducing the Ally web clipper Safari extension</h2><h3 id="strip-advertisements--clutter">Strip advertisements &amp; clutter</h3><p>The Ally web slipper automatically removes all the ads and complex formatting that plague modern websites so when you read it later, you can focus on the content. Read in <a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/macos-full-screen-mode/">Ally’s Full Screen mode</a> for ultimate focus and immersion.</p><h3 id="permanent-save--accessible-files">Permanent save &amp; accessible files</h3><p>With a single click, you can archive a permanent copy of whatever web page you’re on as a Markdown file. If the website disappears, if the article is put behind a paywall, or if you don’t have access to the internet, you’ll still have an archived copy of the web content you need.</p><h3 id="add-notes-for-context">Add notes for context</h3><p>Add notes before saving the page so you’ll understand why you thought it was important later. Your future self will thank you. You can also add tags to automatically place it in your Library.</p><h3 id="custom-keyboard-shortcuts">Custom keyboard shortcuts</h3><p>Configure whatever keyboard shortcut you want for the fastest save possible. No reason to touch a mouse.</p><h3 id="automatic-processing">Automatic processing</h3><p>Your web clippings and web content are automatically processed into vector embeddings and relationships between concepts and data are added to knowledge graph so you can be sure that the content you saved is easily surfaced when you need it. This also means that every web page you archive adds to Ally’s knowledge, so it’s more capable of assisting you with whatever you’re working on.</p><p>One click and it is added to your Inbox. That means you have a permanent copy that’s yours forever. If Reddit removes the post, if the website goes down, etc the data is now yours. The data is immediately chunked and vectorized. Each vector is analyzed for relationships to pre-existing data to form a knowledge graph of interrelated information.</p><p>This means with a single click you’ll store a copy of that information in markdown, turn it into searchable vector embedding, and add it to an evolving knowledge graph so your Ally can retrieve that information when it’s useful and relevant.</p><h2 id="how-to-install-the-safari-browser-web-clipper-extension-on-macos">How to install the Safari browser web clipper extension on macOS</h2><p>The Ally Web Clipper browser extension for macOS and iOS Safari is automatically included when you download the apps from the App Store.
