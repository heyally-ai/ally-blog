It won’t be as refined or polished, and it won’t be wrapped in the unseen layers that enhance the user experience of those commercial products, like sophisticated RAG, multi-step processes that happen invisibly alongside chat, etc.</p></li></ol><p>To be fair, most open source models aren’t even trying to compete with the trillion+ parameter mega models the major tech players are scaling. The focus within the open source community has been more aligned with efficiency over benchmark destroying performance. That’s not to say there aren’t some very big and very impressive models being produced, but open source models are rarely ahead of any of the big 3 (OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic) and never ahead of all three at the same time.</p><p>The models that can be run on consumer hardware are remarkably impressive for their size, but not competitive with the massive, closed-source frontier models, on any benchmark. To put it frankly, they’re less intelligent, less knowledgeable, and less able to follow instructions. It’s impressive how close they stay to the frontier, but they aren’t blazing it. Not in terms of record-setting benchmarks, anyway.</p><p><em>However</em>, this shouldn’t be taken as a slight against the thriving open source AI community which is doing incredible things with far fewer resources than their well-funded commercial counterparts. In fact, it’s incredible what they’ve done, and I’m a huge supporter of the open source AI community. I think it’s a critical counter-balance to a very possible tech dysotopia where the wrong people end up controlling AI and advanced robotics.</p><p>But, simply for expectation setting, it’s important for people to know running Qwen3 30b locally isn’t going to be the same as chatting with GPT 5.1 or Opus 4.5. It’s going to be slower. It’s going to be less intelligent. It’s going to make more mistakes. You won’t be able to instantly flip into Deep Research mode and have it compile a 15 page report with 100 citations after reviewing 450 links. Open source models like Qwen3 30b and GPT-OSS 20b and 120b are <em>insanely</em> capable <em>for their size</em>, marvelous feats of engineering, and it’s mind-bending that we have models as intelligent and capable as these running on our laptops, tablets, and phones, but these models aren’t trillions of parameters and consumer GPUs aren’t comparable to data centers, and that becomes apparent pretty fast after you get ollama or LMstudio installed, pull your first model, and send your first few messages.</p><p>Those first few messages are incredible. I know I felt a sense of awe, personally. This wasn’t something I thought I’d be able to do when I was young enough to care. If all this had happened when I was 95, I like to think I’d still be interested in doing it, just because I could. It was one of those things. It was a moment when technology felt magical again.</p><p>Then, my fan started roaring, my other apps started running slow, and after trying to make it work I realized I just wasn’t going to get the same quality of response I’d come to expect from using the paid models.</p><p>It is really cool to run an AI locally, but it’s even more cool when it gives the right answer, has a great voice mode, is nearly instant, and the phone app is awesome. I can also connect to it Google Drive, etc. That is to say, even if the hardware constraint weren’t there, the layers of backend that facilitate the polished chat experience we’ve come to expect, simply don’t exist for local, open source options.</p><p>However, an open source 30b parameter model being unable to compete head-to-head against models far, far above its weight class on benchmarks, does not mean an equal or better user experience is unachievable with open source models running on consumer hardware.</p><p>It just means it hasn’t been created yet.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 8, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tags/ai/">ai</a></li><li><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tags/llms/">llms</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tools-to-connect-to-many-llms-at-once/">Tools to connect to many LLMs at once</a></h3></header><p>To access the latest frontier AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, and Deepseek, you could pay $100 or more in monthly subscriptions. A cost-saving alternative is to use an AI chat interface — sometimes referred to as a “chatbot UI” or “LLM frontend” (there doesn’t appear to be an agreed upon naming convention). These apps allow you to connect to LLMs via their APIs. This way, you pay only for your actual usage.
