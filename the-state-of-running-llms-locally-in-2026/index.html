The models that can be run on consumer hardware are impressive for their size, but not competitive with the massive frontier models on any benchmark and the experience isn’t comparable in terms of capabilities or polish.</p><p>However, this doesn’t and shouldn’t be taken as a slight against the open source community. In fact, it’s incredible what they’ve done and I’m a huge supporter of the open source AI community. It’s incredible.</p><p>But. I still think for expectation setting it’s important for people to know running Qwen3 locally isn’t going to be the same as chatting with GPT 5.1 or Opus 4.5. It’s going to be slower. It’s going to be less intelligent. It’s going to make more mistakes. These models are incredible for their size, it’s mind-bending that we have models as intelligent and capable as these running on our laptops, but these models aren’t trillions of parameters and consumer GPUs aren’t comparable to data centers, and that becomes apparent pretty fast after you get ollama or LMstudio installed.</p><p>It’s like “this is really cool that I can do this on my computer but ChatGPT is way better and way easier.” Fair. Correct on both counts.</p><p>However, just because a model cannot compete head to head against models above its weight class, that does not mean that smaller models cannot be applied and leveraged in ways that give comparable results and with a comparable or even better user experience.</p><p>One key principle is not asking a model to do more than it is capable of. That is, knowing and respecting its limits. You may be able to flood Gemini with a 800k textbook and chat with it, but you won’t be able to do that with GPT-OSS 20B. In fact, giving it just a dozen pages will slow the chat experience to a crawl.</p><p>That doesn’t mean a similar experience isn’t possible, it just means a different approach must be engineered and that could take a variety of forms:</p><ul><li>Multi-model intelligence - rather than utilizing a massive multi-modal model, the local approach instead utilizes a collection of models, chosen to respect the resources of the device,</li><li>Resource polling - devices pool resources across secure networks to create secure clusters that can be tapped into.</li><li>Input engineering - all context and prompts are optimized for maximal effectiveness at minimal tokens.</li><li>Workflow engineering - rather than simple input/output, a more complex process happens behind the scenes often involving processing, routing, and specialized agents with optional tools at their disposal. This can be very effective, and the experience good, when hundreds of tokens can be churned every second by a frontier models. Asking Qwen3 8b to run that workflow would take a lot longer, fail a lot more often, and offer a much lower quality experience.</li></ul><p>And at that point, it’s like “Well, I guess I’ll just pay the $20 or $40 a month it takes to have access to the best models.”</p><p>And that does make sense, for now.</p><p>Ally was created to change that. At The Bright Company we believe that secure, private local AI built on open source models and software can provide an experience that rivals and even exceeds what’s possible with OpenAI, Gemini, etc.</p><p>We don’t think the potential of open source models running on edge devices is tapped. In fact, we think it’s unexplored because so much is being invested in the race to AGI.</p><p>And, to be frank, the world needs a viable alternative to the major players who, frankly, have a track record of inserting ads where they’re unwelcome, mining user data without conscious, and in general exploiting their relationship with consumers.</p><p>AI is clearly a new kind of technology. At its best, it promises helpful companionship and “always there assistance” throughout life. Like that kids robot movie. We already know that the more you share with AI, the more helpful it can be. The logical extension of that is that if it has all context of your life, it can be very helpful. If it heard every sound, if it saw every detail, and could not only recall that info but was also constantly processing it for new ways to assist you with your future plans, that’d be amazing. It’d also mean giving Meta, or OpenAI, or Amazon access to literally your entire life. Sure, they can say it’s processed locally. They can say it won’t show you ads. And, you know what, 10 years after they have it in your home they only sell robots that will occasionally recommend certain brands when putting together your shopping list. We’ve been down this road before, so when the second or third wave of consumer robots are surprisingly cheap, don’t act like you don’t know how this plays out.</p><p>No thank you. Big tech has a very low standard for consumer respect and I do not want to be a part of it. It actually sickens me that pricing is driven by profit instead of value. That enshitifucation is a predictable thing as a once cool product loses its way as it tries to increase metrics and profits quarter after quarter year after year.</p><p>All that can be avoided by creating a product that simply does not collect consumer information. Period. You don’t even create an account. All your data stays local. Nothing is ever sent off your device. That means you can interact with AI without worrying that your new idea will be used as training data for the next model and then be shared with hundreds of people, that your chats with sensitive medical info or health topics will leak, that your chats won’t be used to sell you hyper targeted ads that take into account everything you’ve ever shared with that company and Ai, etc.</p><p>The Bright Company, the company behind Ally, me and my dog, Roach, and my wife gives a lot of input with I appreciate, created</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 7, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tags/ai/">ai</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://heyally.ai/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/authors/brian-gladu/" rel="author">Brian Gladu</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tools-to-connect-to-many-llms-at-once/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Tools to connect to many LLMs at once</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/authors/brian-gladu/" class="feed__author">Brian Gladu</a> <time datetime="2025-12-07T14:21" class="feed__date">December 7, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tools-to-connect-to-many-llms-at-once/">Tools to connect to many LLMs at once</a></h3></header><p>To access the latest frontier AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, and Deepseek, you could pay $100 or more in monthly subscriptions.
