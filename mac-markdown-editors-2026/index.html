It’s refined, elegant, and it does its job well. So, it’s no surprise it’s been the go-to mac app for Markdown editing for over a decade now.</p><p>iA Writer integrates a simple file management solution that may be adequate for most users, but may not be enough for power users trying to create a productivity system or PKM style “second brain.” Those users may be more interested in something like Obsidian…</p><h2 id="obsidian"><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a></h2><p>No list of markdown editors would be complete without the undisputed king of robust markdown editing. If you’re looking for a markdown editing experience that can become a full productivity system, then you’ll find no peer. It has a massive library of community created plugins for pretty much anything.</p><p>Note that Obsidian’s strength is also its curse. Some users find the complexity created by its near limitless configuration options overwhelming. Some find that they end up spending more time maintaining their Obsidian-based productivity system than they do actually being productive.</p><h2 id="typora"><a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a></h2><p>Typora is often compared to iA Writer with good reason. They’re both minimalistic and simple. To highlight the major difference, I’d say that Typora is more focused on advanced editing capabilities while iA Writer seeks to be a more simplified experience to keep you creative and productive. In other words, if you need advanced markdown features like math/diagram support, then Typora may be your best option.</p><h2 id="bear"><a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a></h2><p>When Bear came onto the scene, it redefined elegance for iOS and macOS productivity apps. Its tag-first approach to organizing notes remains unique and one of the most flexible ways to organize a large library of notes.</p><h2 id="ally"><a href="https://heyally.ai/">Ally</a></h2><p>A new comer, what makes Ally unique is its AI-first approach. There’s no separation between your markdown docs and what the AI sees so you can quickly switch back and forth between editing/creation and an AI that’s always in sync. It also offers a uniquely flexible node system where nodes are simulateously markdown docs, folders, and chats so you can add new nodes without wasting any resources on whether you need a folder, doc, or chat.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 15, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tags/macos/">macos</a></li><li><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/tags/productivity/">productivity</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><div class="feed__content"><header><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://heyally.ai/blog/macos-full-screen-mode/">Ally macOS app gets native full screen mode support</a></h3></header><p>Long periods of unbroken concentration, that most of us require to achieve the deep focus that leads to “deep work,” are increasingly challenging to come by.
