If you’re looking for a markdown editing experience that can become a full productivity system, then you’ll find no peer. It has a massive library of community created plugins for pretty much anything.</p><p>Note that Obsidian’s strength is also its curse. Some users find the complexity created by its near limitless configuration options overwhelming. Some find that they end up spending more time maintaining their Obsidian-based productivity system than they do actually being productive.</p><p>Obsidian has the advantage of being truly cross-platform so if you’re forced to use Windows at work, you can still access your notes.</p><h2 id="bear"><a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a></h2><p><strong>Price: $29.99/year</strong></p><h4 id="notable-features-2">Notable features:</h4><ul><li>Nested tags for flexible file organization</li><li>Great iOS app</li></ul><p>When Bear came onto the scene, it redefined elegance for iOS and macOS productivity apps.

Just hit the <code>+</code> button or use a global keyboard shortcut. Ally is full of thoughtful optimizations like this.</p><h2 id="typora"><a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a></h2><p><strong>Price: $14.99</strong></p><h4 id="notable-features-4">Notable features:</h4><ul><li>Stellar upport for advanced Markdown syntax</li><li>Extreme minimalism on the UI</li></ul><p>Typora is often compared to iA Writer. They’re both minimalistic and simple. To highlight the major difference, I’d say that Typora is more focused on advanced editing capabilities while iA Writer seeks to be a more simplified experience.

Notion is a mature app with a lot of powerful features, which for some can also be its downside. For many, it’s distracting and they end up spending more time building the perfect “Notion productivity system” rather than actually getting things done.

We know our best work comes from focus, but it can be challenging to tailor our digital workspaces to minimize distractions.
